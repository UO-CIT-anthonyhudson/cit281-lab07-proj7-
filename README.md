## CIT 281 Lab 07

In this lab we:
- Create your own GitHub organization for the CIT Minor
- Create your first GitHub repository
- Clone your GitHub repository to your local system
- Create lab JavaScript file, and initialize folder as a Node.js folder
- Update and commit lab JavaScript file to practice with error handling
- Push your changes to GitHub

In this lab I started my GitHub organization, which I am using now, and started the process of cloning my repo to my local system.
